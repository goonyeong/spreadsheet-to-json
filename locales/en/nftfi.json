",
  "nftfi_serviceinfo_popup_paragraph2": "The member who agrees to the NFTFi Service Use may use various financial services within the given service period. The company will provide relevant service guidelines that are easily identifiable for the user. The service is available at the choice of the user and can be terminated at any time when it is not desired. However, the company will not be liable to any loss of digital assets caused by service interruptions, caused by the choice of the user.",
  "nftfi_serviceinfo_popup_paragraph3": "Transaction fees including gas fees may arise during the NFTFi service and in that case, the member must make a full payment for the smooth use of the service. The fee rates may be subject to change at any time and the notification will be provided via various methods including a pop-up message, and so on.",
  "nftfi_serviceinfo_popup_paragraph4": "The Company provides the following services:",
  "nftfi_serviceinfo_popup_paragraph4_a": "a. The NFTFi’s Borrow service consists of registration of lend&borrow products, bidding (including a failure of bidding), signing and managing of lend&borrow contract and completion of lend&borrow contract. First, in the registration of lend&borrow products, the borrower chooses NFTs that they wish to register as collateral. In this stage, criteria for lend&borrow service such as fixed lend&borrow period, token used for borrowing, bidding deadline, etc. are determined. The rate of platform usage fee, tokens used for borrowing are decided, and the platform usage fee will be charged when registering lend&borrow items and will be paid back in full with the signing of the contract. If the contract is not signed, the platform usage fee will not be repaid. Next, when applying for the lend&borrow service product registration, NFT as collateral will be locked within the contract. Second, if users make a successful bid, highest price bidding and waiting period will take place, but if in case of a failure of bidding, cancellation of registration and the ownership of NFT as collateral can be retrieved, leading to an overall failure of bidding. Third, if the bidding deadline expires, the highest bidding price will automatically win the bidding contract and according to the contract and repayment rules, the lend&borrow contract management will proceed. Fourth, if repayment is completed in accordance with the automatic collateral NFT returning rule and when payment deadline expires, the borrower’s NFTFi lend&borrow contract comes to an end with the loss of the ownership of NFT as collateral from the borrower’s side. At this point, the liquidation contract is implemented with a complete process of liquidation and ownership transfer of NFT as collateral.",
  "nftfi_serviceinfo_popup_paragraph4_b": "b. The NFTFi’s Lend service largely consists of three steps including navigating lend&borrow products, proceeding of bidding, and singing of lend&borrow contract. First, NFT holders choose their lend&borrow items by setting specific bidding criteria (i.e. amount of borrowing items, etc.). During the bidding process, the bidding money will be locked within the contract and after making the highest-price bidding, bidders cannot cancel their bidding, retrieve their bidding money and make additional bidding. Second, if bidding initiates, the bidding process will proceed until the successful bidding of NFT products. If the highest price bidding occurs, the retribution of the bidding money can be claimed by the bidder himself and in re-bidding, only the difference from previous bidding price is required to be paid to proceed with the process. Third, if a successful bidding takes place, lend&borrow contract between the lender and borrower will be finally signed. If the payment is made before the deadline, the repayment money will be directly claimed after deducting taxes according to the set lending fee rate. If repayment fails, the ownership of the NFT as collateral will be transferred to the lender.",
  "nftfi_serviceinfo_popup_paragraph5": "Depending on the type of service, the NFTFi service users’ requests may fail or be delayed for various reasons including network traffic congestion, environmental issues, and other unforeseen circumstances. Under these conditions, the company’s service does not offer any guarantee regarding the matter.",

Therefore, the company recommends that you make payments and proceed with the process prior to the set deadline. ",
